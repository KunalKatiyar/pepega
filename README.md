## Features

- **Twitch Emote Syntax**: Pepega supports the usage of Twitch emotes as part of the language syntax, allowing developers to express themselves in a fun and unique way.
- **Rust Implementation**: The interpreter is built using the Rust programming language, leveraging its performance, safety, and concurrency features.
- **Extensibility**: The design of Pepega allows for easy extension and modification, enabling developers to add new Twitch emotes or expand the language's capabilities.
